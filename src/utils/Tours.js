    info: "Steeped in its evocative history and the rapid changes that have taken place over the past two decades, Berlin today exerts its own particular fascination. More than twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the capital projects itself as a young, dynamic and cosmopolitan city at the heart of Europe which is constantly re-inventing itself. Variety is guaranteed, but you can also travel to the German capital for rest and relaxation. In Berlin a fast paced metropolis and relaxing rest areas in nature are not far apart. Whether in Tiergarten, Tempelhofer Freiheit, Görlitzer Park or Grunewald – every district has its green oasis, which improves the quality of living and allows visitors to take a short break.",
